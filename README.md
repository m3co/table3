# Table3

Table tag for MDL/CE that allows you to work with tables.

Here'a a sort list of features we want to see:
- Sort
- Filter
- Column hide/unhide move via D&D
- CRUD
- Inline edit
- Multiple actions
- D&D
...
- And so on...

This tag is intended to work from mobile to big screens...

Let's stop dreaming, and beging to work! :)

Roadmap:

- Render data:
  - [x] [via JS](https://github.com/m3co/table3/commit/f0a18b015cd07f2f2d591e03971afaf42a42651e)
  - [ ] via "dispatcher"
  - [ ] via HTML? does it have any sense?
- Manipulate info
  - [x] [Filter](https://github.com/m3co/table3/commit/0dfd8c3af7d994ad1ce157f6e701324c12de3acd)
  - [x] [Sort](https://github.com/m3co/table3/commit/12dc6d9733d089703026b410f31456a5c171c183)
