# Table3

Table tag for MDL/CE that allows you to work with tables.

Here'a a sort list of features we want to see:
- Sort
- Filter
- Column hide/unhide move via D&D
- CRUD
- Inline edit
- Multiple actions
- D&D
...
- And so on...

This tag is intended to work from mobile to big screens...

Let's stop dreaming, and beging to work! :)

Roadmap:

- Render data:
  - [ ] via JS
  - [ ] via "dispatcher"
  - [ ] via HTML? does it have any sense?
- Manipulate info
  - [ ] Filter
  - [ ] Sort
- CRUD
